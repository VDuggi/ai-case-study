Idea for the company: Eric Lefkofsky founded Tempus in 2015 shortly after finding out his wife was diagnosed with breast cancer. The founders were inspired to start Tempus after seeing the challenges that families face when navigating cancer care. They wanted to create a company that could use technology to make precision medicine more accessible and affordable for everyone.  
Funding: Tempus has raised over $1 billion in funding from investors such as SoftBank, Fidelity Investments, and T. Rowe Price.

## Business Activities
Problem solved: Tempus is solving the problem of making precision medicine more accessible and affordable for everyone.
Intended customer: Tempus's intended customers are cancer patients and their families. The market size for this set of customers is estimated to be over $100 billion.
Solution: Tempus offers a platform that uses artificial intelligence to analyze genomic data and provide insights that can help clinicians make better treatment decisions for their patients.
Technologies used: Tempus uses a variety of technologies, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cloud computing.

## Landscape
Field: Tempus is in the field of precision medicine. Precision medicine is a new and rapidly growing field that uses genetic and molecular data to tailor treatments to individual patients.
Trends: The field of precision medicine is rapidly growing, as advances in technology make it possible to sequence and analyze genomic data more quickly and affordably. Some of the major trends in precision medicine include the development of new targeted therapies, the use of real-world data to improve treatment outcomes, and the increasing role of artificial intelligence in drug discovery and development.
Competitors: Tempus's major competitors include Foundation Medicine, Guardant Health, and Flatiron Health, COTA. 

## Results
Business impact: Tempus has tested over 1 million patients to date and has helped to enroll over 10,000 patients in clinical trials for targeted therapies. The company's platform is also being used by pharmaceutical companies to develop new drugs and by healthcare providers to make more informed treatment decisions.
Core metrics: Some of the core metrics that companies in the field of precision medicine use to measure success include the number of patients tested, the number of actionable insights generated, and clinical trial enrollment. Tempus is performing well on all of these metrics.
Relative performance: Tempus is the leader in the field of precision medicine in terms of the number of patients tested and the number of actionable insights generated. The company is also ahead of its competitors in terms of clinical trial enrollment.
> "Tempus is changing precision medicine by making it more accessible, affordable, and actionable. We are doing this by using AI to analyze large amounts of genomic and clinical data to identify insights that can help clinicians make better treatment decisions for their patients." -Eric Lefkosky, co-founder and CEO of Tempus.

## Recommendations
If I were to advise Tempus, I would recommend that the company expand its focus beyond cancer to offer precision medicine solutions for other diseases, such as neuropsychiatric disorders and infectious diseases. I would also recommend that the company develop and offer AI-powered tools to help pharmaceutical companies accelerate the drug discovery and development process.
I believe that offering these additional products and services would benefit Tempus in several ways, including generating new revenue streams, expanding the company's customer base, collecting valuable data, and strengthening the company's brand reputation.
These additional products and services would utilize the same technologies that Tempus currently uses, such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cloud computing. These technologies are appropriate for Tempus's solutions because they allow the company to analyze large amounts of data quickly and efficiently. This is essential for developing and delivering precision medicine solutions.
